To automatically cancel a workflow in CircleCI if a job with hold and approval hasn't been approved within a certain time frame, you can utilize the CircleCI API and write a script or use a tool like a cron job to monitor the status of the job and cancel the workflow if necessary.

Here's an example of how you can approach this using a script:

1. Retrieve the job details using the CircleCI API: Use the API endpoint `GET /project/:vcs-type/:username/:project/:workflow_id/:job_number` to get information about the job. Replace the placeholders (`:vcs-type`, `:username`, `:project`, `:workflow_id`, `:job_number`) with the relevant values for your project.

2. Check the job status: In the response from the API, you can find the status of the job. If the job is in the "hold" state and hasn't been approved within your desired time frame, you can proceed to cancel the workflow.

3. Cancel the workflow: Use the CircleCI API endpoint `POST /project/:vcs-type/:username/:project/:workflow_id/cancel` to cancel the entire workflow. Replace the placeholders with the appropriate values.

4. Set up a scheduler: Depending on your environment, you can use a cron job or a similar scheduling mechanism to run the script at regular intervals, checking the status of the job and canceling the workflow if needed.

By automating this process, you won't have to manually cancel the workflow every time. Instead, the script will handle it for you based on your defined conditions.

Remember to authenticate your requests to the CircleCI API by including the necessary credentials or tokens in your script. Refer to the CircleCI API documentation for more details on authentication and the available endpoints: https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/



Certainly! Here's an example in Python that demonstrates how you can automatically cancel a workflow in CircleCI if a job with hold and approval hasn't been approved within a certain time frame:

```python
import requests
import datetime

circleci_token = "YOUR_CIRCLECI_TOKEN"
workflow_id = "YOUR_WORKFLOW_ID"
job_number = "YOUR_JOB_NUMBER"
threshold_minutes = 60  # Define the time threshold in minutes

# Get the current time
current_time = datetime.datetime.now()

# Calculate the time threshold
threshold_time = current_time - datetime.timedelta(minutes=threshold_minutes)

# CircleCI API endpoint for retrieving job details
api_url = f"https://circleci.com/api/v2/workflow/{workflow_id}/job/{job_number}"
headers = {"Circle-Token": circleci_token}

# Retrieve the job details
response = requests.get(api_url, headers=headers)
job_details = response.json()

# Get the job status and approval time
job_status = job_details["status"]
approved_at = job_details["approved_at"]

if job_status == "on_hold" and approved_at is not None:
    approved_time = datetime.datetime.strptime(approved_at, "%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ")
    if approved_time < threshold_time:
        # Job hasn't been approved within the threshold time, cancel the workflow
        cancel_url = f"https://circleci.com/api/v2/workflow/{workflow_id}/cancel"
        response = requests.post(cancel_url, headers=headers)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            print("Workflow cancelled successfully.")
        else:
            print("Failed to cancel the workflow.")
else:
    print("Job is not on hold or has already been approved.")
```




In this example, you need to replace the placeholders `YOUR_CIRCLECI_TOKEN`, `YOUR_WORKFLOW_ID`, and `YOUR_JOB_NUMBER` with the appropriate values for your CircleCI project.

This script retrieves the job details using the CircleCI API, checks if the job is on hold and has been approved within the specified time threshold. If the job hasn't been approved within that time frame, it cancels the workflow. You can adjust the `threshold_minutes` variable to define your desired time threshold.

Make sure to install the `requests` library (`pip install requests`) before running this script.

You can schedule this script to run at regular intervals using a cron job or any other scheduling mechanism that fits your environment.



To integrate the script into your CircleCI workflow, you can add a step in your configuration file (`.circleci/config.yml`) that runs the script using a programming language executor such as `python` or `bash`. Here's an example of how you can set it up:

1. Create or update your `.circleci/config.yml` file in your project's repository.

2. Add a new step to your workflow configuration, specifying the executor and the commands to run the script. For example:

```yaml
version: 2.1

jobs:
  your_job_name:
    docker:
      - image: circleci/python:3.9  # Use the appropriate Docker image for your script
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Install requests library
          command: pip install requests
      - run:
          name: Run the cancellation script
          command: python cancellation_script.py  # Replace with the actual script name
```

In the above example, the script assumes that you have placed it in the same directory as your `config.yml` file. If not, update the `command` line with the correct path to the script.

3. Customize the configuration file based on your project's requirements, including additional steps, environment variables, and other configuration options.

4. Commit and push the changes to your repository. CircleCI will detect the changes and automatically trigger the workflow.

Once the workflow runs, it will execute the steps defined in the configuration file, including running the cancellation script.

Make sure to replace the placeholder `cancellation_script.py` in the configuration file with the actual name of your script file.

Remember to adjust the Docker image specified in the `docker` section based on the programming language and dependencies required for your script.




Remember that the job number is unique within a specific workflow. If you are interested in a particular job, make sure you are looking at the correct workflow.

Additionally, you can retrieve the job number and workflow ID programmatically using the CircleCI API. Here's an example using the CircleCI API v2:

Get Workflow ID:

Use the API endpoint GET /project/:vcs-type/:username/:project/workflows to list the workflows for a project. Replace the placeholders :vcs-type, :username, and :project with the relevant values for your project.
In the response, locate the desired workflow and extract its ID.
Get Job Number:

Use the API endpoint GET /project/:vcs-type/:username/:project/:workflow_id/jobs to list the jobs within a specific workflow. Replace the placeholders :vcs-type, :username, :project, and :workflow_id with the appropriate values.
In the response, locate the desired job and extract its number.
Remember to authenticate your API requests with the appropriate credentials or tokens. Refer to the CircleCI API documentation for more details on how to authenticate and the available endpoints: https://circleci.com/docs/api/v2/
